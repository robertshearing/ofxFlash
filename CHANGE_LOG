CHANGE LOG.

======================================

ofxFlashInteractiveObject - mouse events listeners are removed when object is destroyed - missed this before.
ofxFlashInteractiveObject - added mouseUpOutside(). object goes back to up state if mouse goes outside of bounds when pressed - this is default behaviour in flash.
ofxFlashDisplayObject - globalToLocal(), globalToLocal3D(), hitTestPoint(), local3DToGlobal(), localToGlobal() - are now working.
ofxFlashStage - added stageMouseX and stageMouseY - so all display objects can get the global mouseX and mouseY from the stage.
ofxFlash_example_02 updated. Box includes mouseDown() visual change.

Added alpha channel support to ofxFlashShape.
Added alpha channel support to ofxFlashDisplayObject
Added compound alpha, which is the multiple of alpha down the parent/child chain.
Alpha blending is now enabled before all flash assets are drawn to screen and turned off when finished - previously it was done per asset.
Removed dependencies on POCO events so its now optional.
ofxFlash now working on the iPhone / iPad.
- had to introduce touch mode as mouse and touch events behave differently. touch mode needs to be set to true on ios devices.
